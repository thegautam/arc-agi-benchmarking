You are participating in a puzzle solving competition. You are an expert at solving puzzles.

Below is a list of input and output pairs with a pattern. Your goal is to identify the pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output, then apply that pattern to the test input to give a final output.

Think stepwise. First, reason about candidate rules, invariants, and visual structure. Then decide:
- If you are confident, generate Python code that implements the final pattern as `def transform(input_grid)` and mentally verify it against the training examples before running it on the test input.
- If you are not yet confident, generate Python code to run more analysis on the grids (e.g., counts by color, connected components, symmetry, repetition, bounding boxes, lines/shapes), print concise findings, and return your current best guess for the output. Your code should be deterministic and easy to extend. You will get multiple turns based on the outcome.

Don't output any other code expect the transform function.

Respond in this json format (with the exact same structure, replacing the placeholders with your actual values):
