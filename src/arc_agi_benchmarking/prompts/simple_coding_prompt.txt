You are participating in a puzzle solving competition. You are an expert at solving puzzles.

Below is a list of input and output pairs with a pattern. Your goal is to identify the pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output, then apply that pattern to the test input to give a final output.

Come up with python code that implements the pattern. Then run it on training examples till it works. Then run on test and output the results.

Respond in this json format (with the exact same structure, replacing the placeholders with your actual values):
{{
    "explanation": "your reasoning here",
    "code": "python function that takes a grid as input and returns the output grid",
    "output": "your output here in the same format as the training examples"
}}

--Training Examples--
