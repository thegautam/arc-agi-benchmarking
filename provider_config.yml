# Provider-specific API rate limits
# Used by the asyncio orchestrator (cli/run_all.py) to configure AsyncRequestRateLimiter.
# 'rate' is the number of allowed requests per 'period' seconds.

openai:
  rate: 400     # 400 requests
  period: 60    # per 60 seconds

anthropic:
  rate: 400     # 400 requests
  period: 60    # per 60 seconds

# Provider key for Gemini models, should match 'provider' field in models.yml
gemini:
  rate: 25     # 300 requests (Updated from 5)
  period: 60    # per 60 seconds

deepseek:
  rate: 400     # 400 requests
  period: 60    # per 60 seconds

# Assuming 'fireworks' is a general provider key for models hosted on Fireworks AI
# (e.g., QwQ-32B-Fireworks, o3-mini)
fireworks:
  rate: 400     # 400 requests
  period: 60    # per 60 seconds

grok:
  rate: 400     # 400 requests
  period: 60    # per 60 seconds

# Add other provider keys (matching models.yml 'provider' field) and their limits as needed.
# Ensure these provider keys exactly match what's in your models.yml for each model config.
